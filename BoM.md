# gDesk BoM (Bill of Materials)
This is the BoM for the gDesk, the desktop computer designed by LiveG.
## Processor
The gDesk is based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, featuring the Broadcom BCM2711 CPU, which is a quad-core Cortex-A72 processor.
## RAM
The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is available in various RAM configurations (1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB), but the gDesk will be available in only 4GB and 8GB configurations, as we have reasoned that for most people these will be the most suitable amounts of RAM.
## Storage
For the gDesk, we will be using the 0GB 'Lite' versions of the CM4. This is because the gDesks will feature an NVMe storage drive for boot and mass storage. This is likely to be a WD Blue SN550. Therefore, the gDesk will be available with 250GB, 500GB, 1TB or 2TB of fast SSD storage. This makes the gDesk an ideal computer for most use cases, even those with high storage requirements.
## Communications
The gDesk will have full WiFi and Bluetooth using an antenna on the back of the casing for superior radio connectivity, whilst wired network connections will be handled by a Gigabit Ethernet port. The Raspberry Pi GPIO will be broken out to the back of the gDesk, in a similar way to the Raspberry Pi 400. This will allow users to connect sensors and actuators directly to the gDesk, with minimal wiring. The gDesk will have 2 USB Type-A ports running at USB 2.0 speeds, which should be sufficient for most users due to the NVMe boot drive and the fast internet connection possibilities.
## Display/Graphics
The gDesk will include dual 4K HDMI 2.0 connectors to run up to two displays. The gDesk will be able to run a single display at 4K 60Hz, or two displays at 4K 30Hz.
