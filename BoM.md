# gDesk BoM (Bill of Materials)
This is the BoM for the gDesk, the desktop computer designed by LiveG.
## Processor
The gDesk is based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, featuring the Broadcom BCM2711 CPU, which is a quad-core Cortex-A72 processor.
## RAM
The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is available in various RAM configurations (1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB), but the gDesk will be available in only 4GB and 8GB configurations, as we have reasoned that for most people these will be the most suitable amounts of RAM.
## Storage
For the gDesk, we will be using the 0GB 'Lite' versions of the CM4. This is because the gDesks will feature an NVMe storage drive for boot and mass storage. This is likely to be a WD Blue SN550. Therefore, the gDesk will be available with 250GB, 500GB, 1TB or 2TB of fast SSD storage. This makes the gDesk an ideal computer for most use cases, even those with high storage requirements.
